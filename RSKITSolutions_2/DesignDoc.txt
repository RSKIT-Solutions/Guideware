For every source/account number which has Output Name as "Insured Cancellation Notice" ... we will then lookup in the 
Doxiom excel sheet and try to find the same.

if we do not find it ... we have to then go back to GW portal and send this job for Batch Priting

Then download that zip based on naming convention
Extract the file create from the zip file
Keep it in temp folder
and then once we have exchauseted all the source/account number from the GW download we 
Zip all the files in temp folder
Load them in the gdrive location
